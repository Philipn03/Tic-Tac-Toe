# Tic-Tac-Toe

 Tic Tac Toe is a 2-player game where one player's game piece is X and the second player's game piece is O (letter). The players take turns putting 1 of their game pieces in 1 of the empty slots in the 3 by 3 board. 
 The first player to get 3 of their game pieces to align (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) wins. If the board has no empty slots and neither of the players has already won, no one wins and the game ends in a tie.
 
 For coordinates, type in the following format 'x y'
 
The prompt after the game is finished should be “Do you want to play again?”
- “Y” or “y” should restart the game
- “N” or “n” should exit the game
